tickers.py
----------
Defines the universe of US defense-industry stocks evaluated by this
project, split into the two sub-industries named in the checklist:
Aviation and Shipbuilding. Same "name -> ticker or None" pattern as the
sibling ford-global-eval / japan-shipbuilder-eval projects, plus a
TICKER_CANDIDATES fallback list for tickers that may not resolve cleanly
on the primary exchange.
