"""
data.py
-------
Fetches stock data from yfinance and computes financial metrics (P/B, P/E,
Market Cap) for the US defense dashboard. Every fetch defaults to
period="max" so history always runs through the most recent completed
trading session ("backed up to the latest day" per user spec) -- yfinance
itself, not a cron job, is what keeps this current: every call re-pulls
through today's session.

All functions handle missing/unavailable data gracefully (never raise) --
matching the sibling ford-global-eval / japan-shipbuilder-eval projects'
discipline so pipeline.py and the Streamlit app never crash on a bad ticker
or missing field.
